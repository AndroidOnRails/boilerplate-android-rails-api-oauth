# README

This is a simple Rails web application which is designed to used with
the bundled Android applicaiton.

This webapp provides a (currently unused and untested) API.  The API
allows authentication via OAuth2, and is currently configured to use 
the Google oAuth2 provider.

I intend to further explain the function of this application soon.

## Usage

Change the values in the config/application.yml.  This file should 
contain your API details. Further information to follow..
