# BoilerPlate Android Application

This application was developed using the sources originally found at https://github.com/ribot/ribot-app-android.

## About
After searching for a decent set of documents discussing the MVP pattern of Android development
I came across the Ribot app.  The Ribot app was originally designed to to connect to the the Ribot
API server.  However, I prefer to write APIs using Ruby and Rails, so I converted the Ribot app
to talk to a very simple Rails API.   You can find the Rails API server in my parent directory.

## Coming Soon
A discussion of how this application is developed, and how to further extend it will be published
soon.  Watch this space.
