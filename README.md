# About

This is an attempt to demonstate the development of an Android project
utilising the MVP pattern to connect to a Rails API server which is configured
with oAuth2 via the Devise plugin.

Once complete, this will show how to use multi oAuth providers with multiple
client tokens.

Feel free to fork.
